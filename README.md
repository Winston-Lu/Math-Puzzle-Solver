# Math-Puzzle-Solver

A math puzzle given to me to find the highest score depending on the path chosen. No overlaps in paths with the exceptions of crossing over. This method uses a breadth-first search, storing the data into a stack. The size of the maze given may create a stack a few gigabytes in size, and further optimizations are possible for dead-end paths.
